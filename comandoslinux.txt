Lesson 1

1.
pwd - Print directory (shows where we are)

2.
ls - show the content of a selected folder 
We can restrict the content showed by adding the name of the file we are looking for, we can also use wild cards (??), by doing for example, ls b??k on a folder that have files named book, bulk and brook. the ls search will return only book and bulk files.

3. 
cd/rm/mv/cp/mkdir

cd- change directory - double tab to see where to go while navigating on directories trough terminal.

mv comand can be used to change files name (ex: mv a.txt b.txt) and to move files to a diferent directory (mv a.txt Downloads).

cp is used to copy a file (cp  a.txt b.txt it will copie the content of a to b), also (cp a.txt ~/Downloads) will make a copy of a .txt on Downloads directory.

If we need to copy an directory with other directories inside, we need to use cp -r command, otherwise it will only copy the directory and it's files. Also we can use -rf to force the r comand if necessary.

the -r command is necessary to remove folders.

mkdir to makes directories

if we want to make remove, move, copy... all the file of a certain extension we can use *.extension. (ex: rm *.doc) as result we will remove all the files of .doc extension


4.
ctrl+r to check the history commands
type (history -c) to clear

5.
Combining commands
ex:we can use (touch a.txt && vim a.txt) as reusult we will create the file as we start to edit that same file on Vim.
